      <description>Mapping fatalities from violence in Africa in 2017In my previous post I showed how I was trying to get data directly from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), in an R pipeline.
Here’s a quick example of what it allows you to do. The visualisations in this aren’t pretty, it’s mainly meant as an example of what you can easily do. I’m really enjoying using sf to plot maps in ggplot2, thanks to Matt Strimas-Mackey showing how to get that working.</description>

      <description>Update: I’ve updated a couple of these functions, as they were messy and unreliable (they probably still are!). I’ve also put them together as a mini-package that you can install from gitub: hdxr If you’ve ideas on how I should do it better, please let me know on github/twitter.
I’ve been trying to make it easier for me to get information from the Humanitarian Data Exchange. The folk who run the centre have been trying to make it easier to access too, they’ve released a python api, and they use CKAN so you can download JSON information about each ‘package’ (basically the subject of the data) and each ‘resource’ (the data itself).</description>

      <description>Using the geofacet package to plot deprivation in Scotland by Health BoardsA few months ago, when I was first starting to learn to use R, I tried looking at the data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. The Scottish Government split Scotland up into 6976 equally populated “data zones” (not quite neighbourhoods, but pretty close), and ranked them from most deprived (1), to least deprived (6976)
Recently I’ve gone back to the same files, to see if what I’ve learnt has made it easier to look at deprivation in Scotland.</description>
