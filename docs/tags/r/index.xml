      <description>tl:dr snakes is a package containing data on individual snake species, from the World Health Organization Snake Database. You can get an early version from “devtools::install_github(”callumgwtaylor/snakes“)”
Recently for an assignment for my masters I was looking at the global burden of snakebite. Keen to get some pretty diagrams in to distract the reviewers from my terrible writing, I went online to find a resource we could analyse in R. This had worked well enough for previous essays, especially with the existence of The Humanitarian Data Exchange, plus a mini package I’d written for my own purposes to import their data easily.</description>

      <description>Cholera in Yemen : UPDATED 16-DECEMBER-2017At the time of writing, the WHO has released information about 959810 cases of cholera in Yemen, with 2219 deaths. This post uses data released on 2017-11-26. This information has been collated by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), and put online. All the information below has been taken from HDX and read into R using hdxr. The code to run it all is in this rmarkdown document</description>

      <description>Publicly available data about the cholera crisis in Yemen is provided through bulletins from the World Health Organistion. Released online, each one gives the most recent running total of cholera cases and deaths in each part of the country. You can get a copy yourself here
The code to recreate this map and the plot is available here
The map below shows the most recent numbers.</description>

      <description>Cholera in Yemen : UPDATED 12-JULY-2017At the time of writing this, the WHO has released information about 320199 cases of Cholera in Yemen, with 1742 deaths.
This information has been collated by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), and put online. I made a new function for hdxr the other day to make it easier to use maps from HDX, and wanted to learn more about what’s happening in Yemen.</description>

      <description>Mapping fatalities from violence in Africa in 2017In my previous post I showed how I was trying to get data directly from the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), in an R pipeline.
Here’s a quick example of what it allows you to do. The visualisations in this aren’t pretty, it’s mainly meant as an example of what you can easily do. I’m really enjoying using sf to plot maps in ggplot2, thanks to Matt Strimas-Mackey showing how to get that working.</description>

      <description>Update: I’ve updated a couple of these functions, as they were messy and unreliable (they probably still are!). I’ve also put them together as a mini-package that you can install from github: hdxr. The code below is the OLD version, the up to date versions are on github. If you’ve ideas on how I should do it better, please let me know on github/twitter.
I’ve been trying to make it easier for me to get information from the Humanitarian Data Exchange.</description>

      <description>Using the geofacet package to plot deprivation in Scotland by Health BoardsA few months ago, when I was first starting to learn to use R, I tried looking at the data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. The Scottish Government split Scotland up into 6976 equally populated “data zones” (not quite neighbourhoods, but pretty close), and ranked them from most deprived (1), to least deprived (6976)
Recently I’ve gone back to the same files, to see if what I’ve learnt has made it easier to look at deprivation in Scotland.</description>
