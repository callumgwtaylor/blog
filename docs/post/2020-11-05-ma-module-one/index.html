<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>This essay makes a choice between two deontological ethical theories, determining their usefulness for health-care professionals (HCPs). Accepting as a premise that the ethics of healthcare should be governed by a deontological approach<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, I will contrast an absolutist  argument from Kant, with Ross' pluralist argument of prima facie duties.</p>
<p>I will approach this choice from the perspective of an HCP. HCPs operate in a wide field, from one-to-one interaction with a patient, to the family as a unit of care (seen in palliative care), to the health of the community (public health). The pace can be measured in months and years, or hyperacute in emergency medicine. Rather than restricting view to one particular HCP role, this essay will attempt to find which of the two approaches is most useful
for all HCPs.</p>
<p>Using an example ethical dilemma, I will compare Kant&rsquo;s and Ross' systems, and the principles underpinning them.</p>
<p>I will attempt to explain why Kant&rsquo;s absolutism is too rigid, and how modern defenders of absolutism create holes that a significant number of medical ethical decisions sit in. As a secondary point I will argue that Kant&rsquo;s focus on rationality provides poor justification for our duties to our most vulnerable patients.</p>
<p>I will argue that Ross' acceptance of multiple, conflicting, equally valid principles more accurately reflects the reality of ethical decision making in healthcare. That acknowledging multiple issues and ‘the moral residue’ <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> that comes with more difficult decisions provides a useful system and structure for discussion of ethical decision making. I will contrast this to Kant&rsquo;s approach and attempt to show how Ross provides what Kant lacks in the healthcare setting.</p>
<h2 id="our-ethical-dilemma">Our Ethical Dilemma</h2>
<p>The dilemma used in this essay is adapted from a real case discussed in the journal Pediatrics<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup> and focuses on the ethics of withholding the truth from someone who is both the relative of the patient and a patient themselves.</p>
<p>A young child died in hospital whilst undergoing treatment for their serious but potentially curable illness. The father was at their bedside for their death, however the mother was in her own hospital bed in the later stages of pregnancy and at high risk of misscarriage. The father requests that the medical team withhold the news from the child’s mother for a few weeks, he fears the upset will result in the loss of their unborn child. <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="kant-and-absolutist-deontology">Kant and Absolutist Deontology</h2>
<h3 id="motivation-and-maxims">Motivation and Maxims</h3>
<p>For Immanuel Kant, and for all deontological theories, it’s not the consequence of an action that determines the ethical acceptability; instead the <strong>reason</strong> for an action is what justifies it.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>For Kant, an action is ethical if it follows an ethical “maxim”.<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup> A maxim means the reason, a rule guiding how to act. It is not exactly the same as an intention for an action. Intent does have an ethical impact, but where there can be many different intentions leading into a decision, there can only be one maxim.<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup> As it is the maxim that determines whether an action is ethical or not, when you question the ethics of a decision, you are questioning the underlying maxim.<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup></p>
<p>So what determines if a maxim is ethical or not? For Kant an ethical maxim would be one that comes from a ‘good will’<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>, something that itself is the ‘only unconditional good’.<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup> At this point you are left with another question: How do you decide if a maxim comes from a good
will? It’s here that the ‘categorical imperative’ comes in.</p>
<h3 id="the-categorical-imperative">The categorical imperative</h3>
<p>The categorical imperative can be seen as a test, one that determines if a maxim comes
from a good will, and therefore also if a maxim is ethical.</p>
<p>Kant provides three formulations of his categorical imperative, and argues that they are
ultimately three different ways of saying the same thing.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup> This essay will focus on the first two. The first formulation (the “Formula of Universal Law”) is the most explicit about
absolutism, and the second (the “Formula of the End in Itself”) is often encountered in
discussions of healthcare ethics.<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup></p>
<h4 id="formula-of-universal-law">Formula of Universal Law</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘act only in accordance with that maxim through which you can at the same time will that
it become a universal law’<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Formula of Universal Law tests maxims by stating that “non-universalisable” maxims are
the ones that should be seen as unethical.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p>
<p>In our dilemma the underlying maxim to be tested could be: <br>
<em>“It is right to withhold the truth about a child’s death from their mother”.</em> <br>
Using Kant’s explanation of how a maxim can fail the Formula of Universal Law, we can
describe this maxim as failing through two separate mechanisms.</p>
<p>Firstly the maxim has a <em>‘contradiction in will’<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></em>. When we try and universalise the maxim we realise we don’t wish for a world where everyone withholds the truth about a child&rsquo;s death from their mother. <br>
Secondly if we generalise this maxim further: <br>
<em>“It is right to withhold the truth”</em> <br>
The maxim now has a <em>‘contradiction in conception’<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">16</a></sup></em> apparent. There is a logical inconsistency, in a world where this maxim is universalised no-one expects the truth from each other, and the concept of honesty itself falls apart.<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">17</a></sup></p>
<p>So for Kant the father’s request, and any HCP compliance with it would be simply wrong. However another person may disagree with the choice of the underlying maxim, and provide a universalisable justification for action. This will be detailed further in the Contemporary Kant section below. The problem to identify now, is most of us can see some worthy aims of the father. He wishes to protect those he loves from harm and suffering, through preventing an undesired loss of pregnancy. Kant does not provide a mechanism to weigh potential maxims against each other. His insistence each act can only have one maxim ignores the reality as perceived by many of us that multiple factors influence each decision.</p>
<h4 id="formula-of-end-in-themselves">Formula of End in Themselves</h4>
<blockquote>
<p><em>‘we should never act in such a way that we treat humanity, whether in ourselves or in others, as a means only but always as an end in itself’<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">18</a></sup></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>O’Neill notes the second formulation of the categorical imperative is the version with the greatest cultural impact.<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">19</a></sup> Kant argues the important aspect when interacting with other people is respecting their right to be treated as an independent agent, with freedoms that shouldn’t be impaired.<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">20</a></sup> By treating someone as “just a means”, we are preventing them carrying out their own will. A maxim that prevents someone carrying out their own will creates a ‘contradiction in conception’, as in a world where everyone impedes other’s free will (treating them as a ‘mere means’), then no-one would have the freedom to impede other people. It lacks logical consistency when we try to universalise, and so is not an ethical maxim.<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">21</a></sup></p>
<p>Kant puts that someone’s right to be treated as an independent agent comes from their rational nature. His premise is that it is our rationality that underpins ethical duty, creating our good will. O’Neill follows this point to one conclusion, that we would have the same ethical duty to any being with a rational nature. If we were able to prove that chimps had the same rational nature as us, we would owe them the same ethical duty.<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">22</a></sup></p>
<p>Rationality being the basis of “humanity” and our duty to one another creates a problem for ethics in a healthcare setting. HCPs often are tasked with the care of humans who lack rational nature (e.g. during critical illness, traumatic brain injuries, severe intellectual disability, and psychosis). We would consider those humans to still be considered part of humanity, and to have the same rights as other patients. Rationality does not appear an adequate explanation for our duties to each other. Defenders of Kant extend his duty owed to animals, to provide a duty to incapacitated humans. Kant argued that acting in a humane manner to irrational beings you would be improving your ability to act properly with the next rational being you meet.<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">23</a></sup> However the idea that duty to act humanely to incapacitated beings comes from your need to “practice” for someone else, seems to lack something about the inherent rights of any being, rational or otherwise.</p>
<p>Using the Formula of the End in Themselves, we can see that choosing to withhold the truth from the mother in our scenario, would fail to provide her with the ability to carry out her own will. We are preventing her from choosing her own response to the situation, and picking her response (that of ignorance) for her.</p>
<p>The problem with reliance on rationality may not have explicit relevance to our dilemma above. You could consider whether the acute grief reaction has transformed the father into an irrational actor, or whether the foetus should be considered a being in it’s own right. Both of these are beyond the scope of this essay. However rationality is what Kant uses to justify the second formulation of the categorical imperative, and he also holds that each formulation is the same as the others. If we reject the use of ‘rational nature’ to justify the rights of patients to be treated as ends in themselves, we may need to reject all of Kant’s absolutist approach.</p>
<h3 id="contemporary-kant">Contemporary Kant</h3>
<p>In the Formula of Universal Law, the problem of conflicting duties was highlighted. When we consider the maxims of:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“It is wrong to withhold the truth about a child’s death from their mother”</em></li>
<li><em>“It is wrong to knowingly inflict emotional or physical harm on another being”</em></li>
<li><em>“It is wrong to willingly perform an act that increases the risk of an undesired loss of pregnancy”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>These maxims cannot all be followed in this situation. Following the first appears to break the second and third. Kant does not provide a mechanism for reconciling conflicting duties, beyond delving into each maxim to determine why it may not truly follow the categorical imperative.</p>
<p>The absolutist nature of Kant, that an act and the maxim it comes from are always wrong regardless of any beneficial consequences, can create difficulty for healthcare professionals. Most of us would agree with the conclusion that it would be wrong to withhold the truth from the mother for several weeks as requested by the father. However, if the scale of the dilemma were to change, and we were asked to withhold the truth for a matter of hours to prevent an otherwise certain chance of harm to the foetus, it becomes more difficult to justify that the truth takes absolute importance.</p>
<p>As a modern defender of moral absolutism, Fried writes <em>‘Our first moral duty is to do right and to avoid wrong … We must do no wrong-even if by doing wrong, suffering would bereduced and the sum of happiness increased’</em>.<sup id="fnref:24"><a href="#fn:24" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">24</a></sup> To allow ethical breathing room in cases where there is significant moral distress, Fried does put in some escape clauses. In “catastrophes”, we move into a new ethical space, outside of our usual definitions of right and wrong.<sup id="fnref:25"><a href="#fn:25" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">25</a></sup></p>
<p>This idea of catastrophes being somehow different to everyday ethics provides two problems for absolutism for HCPs. Firstly, it doesn’t appear to be absolutist. Allowing a different maxim/act in case of catastrophes seems to acknowledge that different situations have different contributing ethical pressures, and that to avoid a truly horrible consequence, a small harm may be permissible. Fried’s point that <em>‘emergencies create their own morality in which the rights and obligations of everyday life are loosened or altogether dispensed with’</em> <sup id="fnref:26"><a href="#fn:26" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">26</a></sup> doesn’t provide any clarity what this morality of emergencies should be. This leads to the second problem for healthcare ethics. Acute illness, the hospital setting, the potential death of a loved one, are not considered by most to be “everyday life”. The father in our ethical dilemma would not be considered melodramatic if he was to describe the death of his child and potential harm to his wife as a catastrophe. If we say that he is wrong, that a catastrophe needs to be larger than a family, something like a mass casualty incident or natural disaster; firstly there’s no apparent difference in the category of suffering, rather it’s a matter of scale. Secondly, healthcare professionals respond to almost all mass casualty incidents and natural disasters. HCPs working in these environments would benefit from ethical guidance. Traditional Kantian absolutism appears to rigid for these scenarios, and contemporary defenders try to paint these issues as being “outside ethics” in some way.</p>
<h2 id="ross-and-pluralist-prima-facie-moral-theory">Ross and Pluralist ‘Prima Facie’ Moral Theory</h2>
<h3 id="pluralism">Pluralism</h3>
<p>Pluralist moral theories, like W D Ross’ <em>‘Prima Facie’</em> approach acknowledge what Kant fails to, that a situation can occur where multiple valid duties can contradict each other. Ross writes that acting morally <em>‘is a struggle between a multiplicity of desires having various degrees of worth’</em><sup id="fnref:27"><a href="#fn:27" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">27</a></sup> Rather than there being one principle underlying ethics, there are 27 multiple valid principles that aren’t necessarily connected to each other.<sup id="fnref:28"><a href="#fn:28" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">28</a></sup></p>
<p>Ross describes these multiple principles as <em>prima facie</em>, and this essay will continue to refer to them as such. However, by <em>prima facie</em> (something that appears right or wrong, but on inspection may turn out not to be) Ross meant something closer to <em>pro tanto</em>, something that is always right or wrong, but depending on the circumstances can be overridden by a greater right or wrong. <sup id="fnref:29"><a href="#fn:29" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">29</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="prima-facie-principles">Prima Facie Principles</h3>
<p>These prima facie principles, referred to as &lsquo;basic duties&rsquo;<sup id="fnref:30"><a href="#fn:30" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">30</a></sup> are what determines the ethical nature of an act. Where Kant places a good will with maxims that follow the categorical imperative, Ross puts the balancing of basic duties.</p>
<p>A duty is a factor that affects the ethics of a decision. A basic duty is one that doesn’t stem from another deeper duty.<sup id="fnref:31"><a href="#fn:31" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">31</a></sup> Instead it is self evident, it is it’s own justification. Ross gives the 31 example of how the duty to not lie is dependent on the deeper duties to not break promises and to not do harm. The duty not to lie is a ‘derived duty’, the duties to keep promises (‘fidelity’) and to not harm (‘non-maleficence’) are basic <em>prima facie</em> duties.<sup id="fnref:32"><a href="#fn:32" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">32</a></sup></p>
<p>Another way to look at it would be prime numbers: 3, 7, and 21 are all integers (whole numbers), but 3 and 7 are our basic prime numbers, whereas 21 can be broken down into 3 and 7. To stretch the metaphor, a non pluralist would point out that both 3 and 7 can be broken down into another integer, 1, and that Ross’ pluralism fails to find the ethical duty equivalent to 1.</p>
<p>McNaughton summarises Ross’ basic duties as<sup id="fnref:33"><a href="#fn:33" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">33</a></sup>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fidelity - Duties that come from making a promise</li>
<li>Reparation - Duties that come from having to make up for a previous wrong</li>
<li>Gratitude - Duties to others who have helped us previously</li>
<li>Justice - Duties to ensure a sense of fairness, everyone getting what they deserve</li>
<li>Beneficence - Duties to make things better for others in the world</li>
<li>Self Improvement - Duties to make ourselves better</li>
<li>Non-maleficence - Duties to not harm others</li>
</ul>
<p>For HCPs, we recognise ideas of non-maleficence in <em>‘primum non nocere’</em><sup id="fnref:34"><a href="#fn:34" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">34</a></sup>, ‘first do no harm’. But it’s fidelity that underpins a significant proportion of HCPs’ acts. In taking on a professional role, practitioners are making a contract, a form of promise to society. This promise is what provides trust. Patients expect confidentiality and advocacy, due to the implied promise made by the HCPs.</p>
<h3 id="our-dilemma">Our Dilemma</h3>
<p>For a pluralist in our dilemma, the duties required from an HCP may be different to the duties for another non-clinical individual. Unlike Kant’s approach where if something is not universalisable it is unethical, for Ross every situation has its own specific circumstances that determines the correct course of action.</p>
<p>An HCP has a duty of fidelity to both parents, the premise is that a contract between an HCP and patient/parents of patients would require honesty about the death of a child. The act of determining acceptable levels of honesty is made explicit in other clinical situations; it is common in palliative care to establish what information a patient would or would not like to receive. If the patient has clarified they do not expect or desire certain details about their prognosis, or mechanisms of dying, the HCP is not considered unethical to withhold that information.</p>
<p>In our dilemma the following duties would be considered influential:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fidelity - both parents would expect honesty as an implied promise by HCPs</li>
<li>Justice - both parents have equal claim to the knowledge of their child’s death, it would be unfair to withhold from one what the other has</li>
<li>Non-maleficence - in multiple aspects - the father is attempting to prevent harm to the mother and the foetus, the clinician may consider it harmful to withhold such information, the clinician may also be concerned about causing harm to the mother and foetus through providing the truth, and how declining the father’s request may harm him</li>
</ul>
<p>For Ross, and his pluralist approach, what we need to do now is to weigh these competing factors against each other.<sup id="fnref:35"><a href="#fn:35" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">35</a></sup> Once we have done this and identified which has the greatest 35 sway, we have determined the ‘duty proper’.<sup id="fnref:36"><a href="#fn:36" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">36</a></sup></p>
<p>A criticism of pluralism and the duty proper is brought here by Dancy, that the idea of the duty proper results in us ignoring the “wrong” inherent in our conflicted decisions.<sup id="fnref:37"><a href="#fn:37" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">37</a></sup> I disagree, Ross argues we should find the ‘greatest balance of right over wrong’<sup id="fnref:38"><a href="#fn:38" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">38</a></sup> to determine our duty proper, but a balance doesn’t require that there is no wrong in an action, just that overall an action has more right than wrong. Beachamp and Childress give this leftover wrong a name: ‘moral residue’.<sup id="fnref:39"><a href="#fn:39" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">39</a></sup></p>
<p>A second criticism of pluralism is the “messiness” of it. What makes these duties the important ones? This criticism was hinted at above in the comparison between basic duties and prime numbers. Ross agrees with it to some extent, accepting for example that ‘self improvement’ and ‘beneficence’ may be divisible into some shared basic duty.<sup id="fnref:40"><a href="#fn:40" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">40</a></sup> His messiness is defended by McNaughton, who argues that there’s no reason to expect core ethical principles have some underlying connecting explanation why they are the basic duties.<sup id="fnref:41"><a href="#fn:41" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">41</a></sup> Ross embraces the untidiness, arguing that others’ attempts to get the most efficient slick ethical theory results in some loss of truth about ethical reality.<sup id="fnref:42"><a href="#fn:42" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">42</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="contemporary-pluralism">Contemporary Pluralism</h3>
<p>Pluralist approaches are widespread in medical ethics, Beauchamp and Childress' well-known ‘Four Principles’ of beneficence, non-maleficence, autonomy, and justice have their overlap with Ross’ <em>prima facie</em> duties. Beauchamp and Childress take their principles from ‘general norms derived from the common morality’. They also argue that all ethical norms can be overridden if the circumstances demand.<sup id="fnref:43"><a href="#fn:43" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">43</a></sup> Another criticism can be raised 43 here, the idea that any rule can be overridden seems to go far, surely there are some actions that could never be justified? As each factor gets a weight that depends on the circumstances though, we can imagine factors that have such great weight to them that whilst they could theoretically be overwhelmed, realistically the circumstances in which that would happen are never going to happen. So there may not be any absolute rules, but rather duties with such a great weight it’s impossible to distinguish between them and absolutes.<sup id="fnref:44"><a href="#fn:44" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">44</a></sup></p>
<p>This lack of absolutes also leads to the last major criticism of the* prima facie *principles. Ross doesn’t give a set ranking of how to pick between conflicting duties, this lack of ranking prevents us identifying the most important duty for each situation, ultimately preventing us from knowing what course of action to take. Ross does give some indication of the order of duties. He suggests that generally non-maleficence has the greatest weight, beneficence the least, and all the others sitting somewhere in between. However each situation may put different emphasis on each duty.<sup id="fnref:45"><a href="#fn:45" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">45</a></sup> McNaughton accepts that Ross doesn’t provide a clear pathway of how to pick which duty should have the greatest weight, but denies that is the role of a moral theory at all.<sup id="fnref:46"><a href="#fn:46" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">46</a></sup> This argument is the same as taken by defenders of Kant, O’Neill writes that &ldquo;Kantian reasoning does not even aim to provide an algorithm for action&rdquo;.<sup id="fnref:47"><a href="#fn:47" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">47</a></sup> Ultimately the assignment of this essay was to determine, given the choice of Kant or Ross, which moral theory should HCPs use? Ross doesn’t provide a clear mechanism to weigh conflicting duties, but at least he acknowledges they exist.</p>

<p>In Kant’s absolutist approach and in others’ defence of it, morality comes from ruling out the impermissible.<sup id="fnref:48"><a href="#fn:48" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">48</a></sup> Non-universalisable maxims are identified and actions following from them are forbidden.<sup id="fnref:49"><a href="#fn:49" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">49</a></sup> Once this has occurred all options that remain are allowed.<sup id="fnref:50"><a href="#fn:50" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">50</a></sup> This wide range of choice could be seen as not very helpful for an HCP, how do you pick one action if almost all choices are equally valid? In contrast, Davis writes that a utilitarian would only ever be allowed one option, the action that “maximises utility”.<sup id="fnref:51"><a href="#fn:51" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">51</a></sup> The single right option may seem too restrictive, as it limits us to only following one path, denying us any freedom to choose. A pluralist has an approach somewhere between the two.<sup id="fnref:52"><a href="#fn:52" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">52</a></sup> Having multiple ethical factors decreases the chance of all options being equally valid. If options A to Z all follow the  duty of non-maleficence equally, maybe A to H follow the duty of justice to a greater extent. Amongst A to H perhaps A to C follow beneficence more. It is still possible that there may be only one remaining option that follows all duties to the greatest level possible. It is also possible that there may be a wide range of choices that remain. However, through denying that there is always only one correct course of action, and through providing a range of competing factors to help us determine the “most right” options, pluralism can give HCPs a compromise of freedom to make ethical judgements without overwhelming possibilities.<sup id="fnref:53"><a href="#fn:53" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">53</a></sup></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Kant and Ross’ Ethical Theories both influence contemporary healthcare ethics. We see this in similarities between Kant’s “Formula of End in Themselves” and our concept of patient autonomy, or in comparing Ross’ <em>prima facie</em> duties and the common approach of the “4 Principles of Healthcare Ethics”.</p>
<p>Kant provides a seemingly straightforward approach to ethics, where “what’s right is right and what’s wrong is wrong”. This clarity on first glance can appeal to HCPs. The concept of treating people as ends in themselves gives justification for our concept of autonomy, and universalisable maxims result in a consistency of decisions.</p>
<p>Ross’ <em>prima facie</em> duties have no single underlying explanation provided beyond their “self evident” nature. What’s right one day may be wrong the next, what’s forbidden one day may be necessary tomorrow. These duties may seem to be just a list of ethical factors rather than a true explanation of moral reasons.<sup id="fnref:54"><a href="#fn:54" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">54</a></sup></p>
<p>However, Kant’s consistency can result in ethical imperatives that seem wrong intuitively. Where he attempts to provide a unifying explanation of our ethical duties, his reliance on rationality can exclude some of the most vulnerable in healthcare, denying them “humanity”. Modern defenders of an absolutist approach, cede ground when it comes to the ethics of catastrophes, an area that healthcare cannot ignore.</p>
<p>Ross provides a structure to discuss justifiable ethical decisions, which acknowledges all perspectives and complicating factors. Pluralism also puts a manageable range of options to us, without being overly restrictive. Using the shared terminology of Ross’ <em>Prima Facie</em> Duties or Beachamp and Childress’ Four Principles will not provide a clear answer of which action to pick, but then neither does absolutism. What the terminology does provide, is a shared language for HCPs and patients, to debate and resolve what the right thing to do may be.</p>
