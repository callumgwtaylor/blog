      <description>I’ve been trying to make it easier for me to get information from the Humanitarian Data Exchange. The folk who run the centre have been trying to make it easier to access too, they’ve released a python api, and they use CKAN so you can download JSON information about each ‘package’ (basically the subject of the data) and each ‘resource’ (the data itself). The problem for me is I don’t know python, I’m not comfortable with CKAN, and struggle with JSON also.</description>

      <description>Using the geofacet package to plot deprivation in Scotland by Health BoardsA few months ago, when I was first starting to learn to use R, I tried looking at the data from the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation. The Scottish Government split Scotland up into 6976 equally populated “data zones” (not quite neighbourhoods, but pretty close), and ranked them from most deprived (1), to least deprived (6976)
Recently I’ve gone back to the same files, to see if what I’ve learnt has made it easier to look at deprivation in Scotland.</description>
